**VINES** stands for **V**olume **IN**tegral **E**quation **S**olver. 

VINES is a suite of Python codes for solving volume integral equation formulations of acoustic scattering problems.
These include electromagnetic and acoustic scattering by inhomogeneous obstacles.

The techniques employed are based on uniform (voxel) spatial discretizations, thus enabling acceleration via the fast-Fourier transform. Furthermore, we include recent preconditioning techniques that yield large reductions in iterative solve times.
