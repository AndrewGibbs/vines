VINES stands for Volume INtegral Equation Solver. 

It is a suite of Python codes for solving volume integral equation
formulations of acoustic scattering problems.

These include electromagnetic and acoustic scattering by inhomogeneous obstacles.

The techniques employed are based on uniform (voxel) spatial discretizations, 
thus enabling acceleration via the fast-Fourier transform.
